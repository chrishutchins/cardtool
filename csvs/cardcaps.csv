Synchrony,Venmo Card,Top Category,"Grocery, Travel, Dining, Entertainment, Internet/Cable, Phone","Okay I'm going to implement the spending caps now. There are a few different cap types. We can go through them one by one if that's helpful. One is a combined category cap. In this situation the cap on column in the CSV I'm uploading will include a list of categories. So in this example it might say dining, grocery, gas, and the cap will be $15,000. That means that the first $15,000 in all of those caps will earn the bonus amount. So if each of those categories earned 3x, the first $15,000 will earn that 3x. And then everything after $15,000 combined across all three categories will only earn whatever the base rate is. That's how the combined categories work. Anytime you see a category in the cap on field that doesn't currently exist, let's add that category and we can update later what the earnings rates are for those categories for those cards. Next there is a one called selected category. In that specific example there are multiple categories that earn a bonus but only the one the user selects earns that bonus up to the cap. So for example in the BOA business customized cash card there's gas, there's office supply, there's software. Whichever one of those categories is selected is the category that earns the elevated amount. So if it's 3x it would earn 3x but only selected. For those cards where there is a selected category, there's going to need to be a field for each user to select the category for that card otherwise it won't earn a bonus on any categories. The easiest one is probably single category cap type. That means that there's just a single category. So for example on the Amex Gold Card it says single category cap on dining. In that case dining's elevated earning of 4x caps out at $50,000 of spend. There are a few cards where the Everything Category is capped out. Let's just put those caps in for the Everything Category. How that's going to work is they might earn 2x points on everything up to $50,000 and after that earn 1x points. Let's implement it and I can review those particular examples since there only a few after. Then next there is a few cards with a Top Category cap type. So for example the Synchrony Venmo card there are five or six categories. Whichever one has the highest amount of spending will earn the elevated bonus. In that case the top category on the Venmo card earns 3x. Whichever one of those categories has the highest amount of spending, the Venmo card will earn 3%. Whichever one earns the second highest spending will earn 2% and everything else on the card earns 1%. I haven't added the second top category yet. I did! It's called Second Top Category on the Venmo card. I don't know how we should implement that but that's how that one will work and then there's a couple other ones there's Top Two and Top Three categories. The Hyatt Business Card has a list of seven or eight categories where it will earn 2x points on the top three of those categories in terms of spend but not the rest. So if each of those categories has $5,000 of spend then I guess it would be random but let's assume that's not possible. So if each one has a different number whichever three spending categories have the most amount of spending it'll earn 2x. All the other categories won't earn that bonus. We can think of a creative way to implement that if we need and then on the AMEX Business Gold similarly there's a list of categories and each of those categories will earn the elevated bonus on those categories up to the cap. Some of these there is no cap so if there's a blank field in the cap that means that they might only earn that elevated bonus in one of the categories but there is no cap so in effect we're actually not just adding caps but we're adding these features that allow you to earn elevated bonuses in selected or top categories.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
