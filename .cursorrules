# CardTool Project Rules

## Database Schema Changes
When creating Supabase migrations that add or modify tables/columns:
1. Create the migration in `supabase/migrations/`
2. **ALWAYS update `src/lib/database.types.ts`** in the same commit to include the new types
3. The types file must stay in sync with the database schema or builds will fail

## Tech Stack
- Next.js 16 with App Router
- Supabase for database (accessed via service role key, not RLS)
- Clerk for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- TypeScript throughout

## Code Style
- Use server components by default, client components only when needed
- Server actions for mutations (in page.tsx files with "use server")
- Dark theme UI (zinc-900/950 backgrounds, zinc-300/400 text)
- Consistent tooltip style using fixed positioning (see existing Tooltip components)

## Testing
- Build must pass (`npm run build`) before pushing
- Test UI changes in browser before considering complete
